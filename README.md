- Language: [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)
- Framework: [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- Framework: [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/)
- Database: [MongoDb](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- Testing: [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
- Source control: [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control)

## Prerequisites

- Install Node.js with [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).
- Use [node 12](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/) (current node LTS version).

## Setup ENV file
- Please make sure to set-up .env file.
- For your convenience .env file has been checked in with original values. ***Checking in .env file is not recommended for production***.

## Database

- Mongodb connection url:
```
mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@property-listing.u2tjw.mongodb.net/<database>
```

## ðŸš€ Quick start

- Run `npm install` to install all packages used in the project.
- Run `npm start` to start the api.
- Run `npm run dev` to start development mode.
- Run `npm test` to run all the tests in the test folder or files with `xxx.test.ts`.
- To access [playground](http://localhost:3000/graphql).

## Design Decisions

-  Using [SimplyRETS](https://docs.simplyrets.com/) api by wrapping REST api in [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/).
-  Listings query api,  will fetch data both SimpleRETS and mongo db Listing collection.
-  ToggleFavorite query to toggle favorites for user.
-  If user has already marked a listing as favorite, ToggleFavorite will remove the favorite.
-  For each user favorite listing will be stored in user collection's.
-  Used Basic HTTP Authentication , as mentioned in the acceptance criteria.
-  For username and password for basic authentication, please refer to the ***mongodb collection details*** below.
-  Using [jest](https://jestjs.io/) for unit testing

## Samples to run in [playground](http://localhost:3000/graphql)

    }
